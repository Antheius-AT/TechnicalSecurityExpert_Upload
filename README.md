# TechnicalSecurityExpert_Upload

Diverse uploads intended as evidence of expertise for the TechnicalSecurityExpert career path within Gregor Faiman's master's program at FHTW. This README is meant to provide an overview of the uploaded files.

## Contents of the Python Folder

This folder contains two scripts written during a team project in 2020. The project involved creating the logic for a robot prototype whose primary function was to respond to a distress call, take photos of the surroundings, and send these photos to a pre-configured email address. The two Python files provide functions for both sending the email and creating a folder for the current date.

Specifically, it includes:

* The file *SendMail.py* contains functions used for sending emails and certain validations.
* The file *CreateArchive.py* contains functions used for validations and for automatically creating a directory for the current date if it does not already exist.

## Contents of the Webtechnologien Folder

This folder contains three web projects created during the bachelor's program.

1. The project FourWins_SignalR was a team project, developed in C# using SignalR, with the aim of implementing a multiplayer version of Connect Four. I collaborated with three other students on this project.

2. The project PoolDiary is a solo project focused on maintaining a pool diary where various measurement criteria relevant to a pool can be recorded. Technologies used include Angular for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, with RethinkDB as the specified database.

3. The project XSS_vulnerability_sample was a joint project with another student. It involved implementing an XSS vulnerability for an IT security course and demonstrating it for subsequent resolution by fellow students. This project also used Angular for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and RethinkDB as the database.

Links to the original repositories:

* The project with the implemented XSS vulnerability: [XSS-Dummy](https://github.com/TTMVP-AT/XSS-Dummy)
* The project with the Pool Diary implementation: [Webentwicklung](https://github.com/Antheius-AT/Webentwicklung)
* Unfortunately, the 4-Gewinnt SignalR project repository is not public. Although I have clearance from colleagues to upload the code here, since the repository was created by our instructor, I am not authorized to make it public.

## Contents of the Other Folder

This folder contains excerpts from the curriculum of my bachelor's program, particularly from courses where I believe the acquired knowledge is relevant. Additionally, there is a motivation letter explaining why I chose this specialization. Furthermore, a PacketTracer certificate obtained during the course "Operating Systems and Networks" is included.
